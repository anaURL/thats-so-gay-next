              As a software developer with intrinsic passion and interest in
              women's and LGBTIQ+ human rights, I believe in technology as a tool
              for self-expression, deconstructing partiarchy and social change in
              general. As a queer person, I have experienced or witnessed most of
              the microagressions and therefore decided to use my tech skills to
              build a dedicated platform with the purpose of unlearning harmful
              behaviour toward queer community. This platform was build with a
              mission to help people learn about microaggressions without fear of
              judgement.{" "}

            , the first encyclopedia of microagressions. I appreciate any feedback
            and suggestions on experienced microagressions, especially from the
            perspectives of the queer and other marginalized communities. Feel
