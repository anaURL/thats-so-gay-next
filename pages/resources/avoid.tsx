            As suggested by the name, microaggressions seem small; but
            compounded over time, they can have an enormous impact on a person‚Äôs
            experience, health, and overall well-being. Research suggests that
            subtle forms of interpersonal discrimination like microaggressions
            are at least as harmful as more-overt expressions of discrimination.
            Below are some helpful tips from researchers to consider:{" "}

            {" "}
            Don‚Äôt be in a rush to speak or act. Pause before asking someone a
            personal question. Pause before you describe a person‚Äôs personality
            in a certain way. Pause before you make a comparison between someone
            and something else you‚Äôve seen. These simple thoughts and moments
            are where bias lives so taking a second to think about it make all
            the difference.{" "}

          <h2 className="text-3xl m-4 mt-8 font-black"> ü§® QUESTION </h2>
          <p className="text-2xl m-4">
            {" "}
            Ask yourself these important questions. Is your brain getting stuck
            on differences that you‚Äôre noticing? Are they triggering things that
            you subconsciously believe? Are you making assumptions because of
            these beliefs? What will the person I‚Äôm interacting with feel or
            think when I say or do this? Awareness of our own bias comes when we
            answer these questions for ourselves.{" "}
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl m-4 mt-8 font-black"> üñº REFRAME </h2>
          <p className="text-2xl m-4">
            See the bigger picture. Sit in the uncomfortableness of your
            questions. List the things you can do to change your thoughts and
            behaviors. This could include researching other cultures and the
            history of certain phrases to acknowledging the systems that give
            you the privilege of removing offensive phrases from your vocabulary
            one by one. Stop your defensive thoughts. Acknowledge that you can
            cause microaggressions, but it doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person.
            Unlearning bias won‚Äôt happen overnight.
